    <ul>
        <li>450g block firm (or extra-firm) tofu, drained</li>
        <li>&#188; Tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>&#189; Tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>&#189; Tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>&#188; Tsp paprika</li>
        <li>&#189; Tsp kala namak (AKA indian black salt), plus more to finish</li>
        <li>Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>1 generous Tbs tahini</li>
        <li>2 Tbs nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>&#189; cup (120 ml) full-fat oat milk, <em>(or other creamy plant milk)</em></li>
        <li>1 Tbs olive oil or cooking oil of choice</li>
        <li>Sea Salt or kosher salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain the tofu. <em>(Skip this step if you're using extra-firm).</em> Line a cutting board with a few layers of paper towels or a thin dish towel. Place the tofu on top, then weigh it down with a heavy cookbook, or a large plate weighed down by a few cans of beans. Press the tofu for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the eggy sauce.</strong> In a bowl, whisk together the turmeric, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, chipotle, kala namak, black pepper, tahini, and nutritional yeast. Pour in the milk gradually and whisk until you have a nice sauce.</li>
        <li>Crumble the pressed tofu with your hands into chunks, not too big or too small (see photos in step-by-step instructions for the size). </li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat with the oil. Once the oil is hot, add the tofu to the pan, and fry until it's lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir occasionally but not too often to allow the exterior to get lightly browned. Break up any large chunks of tofu with your spatula but don’t break it up too finely.<p>If you prefer scramble on the dry side, cook for a few minutes. If you prefer it on the wet side, cook for just 30-60 seconds.</p></li>
        <li>Add the eggy sauce and fold to combine, using a silicone spatula to coat each piece of tofu with the sauce. Continue frying the tofu until you reach your desired texture and consistency.</li>
        <li>Finish the scramble with a few shakes of kala namak. Taste, and add a pinch of kosher salt or sea salt as needed. Reheat leftovers in a frying pan or in the microwave. </li>
    </ol>
